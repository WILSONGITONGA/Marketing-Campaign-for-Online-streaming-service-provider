    "*   Conditional statements, comparison operators, and logical operators play a major role in automating processes and controlling the branching of code execution.\n",
    "*   Conditional statements allow you to determine whether a specific set of criteria has been met.\n",
    "*   Comparison operators allow you to compare pairs of values.\n",
    "*   Comparison operators such as `>=` and `<=` can be combined to select a range of data within a specific parameter.\n",
    "*   Logical operators such as `and` and `or` allow you to check more than one condition at a time."
